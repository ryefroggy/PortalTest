I chose to save the events as a data structure of an event objects.
It makes it easier to keep track of the names and the times of each event by 
keeping the information for each one in one place (instead of multiple arrays).
Then I went through and changed it into a minute format based off of military time
in order to make it easier to compare the times. Then I check if they are already
in the array of conflicts before adding them to it. I didn't get around to
potential edge cases yet.
